    "A Newbie who is venturing into the field of data science is often confused between choosing pyhton and R as his language of choice. A couple of years ago if you had asked a data scientist what is the programming language of his choice he would have answered probably 'R'. But in recent times **Python** with its expanding user base started to replace 'R'. Unlike **R** which is built by statisticians and aimed to cater for statisticians, Python is a more general purpose programming language. R once had an upper hand on analysing and visualising data but with the active work put into improving python's libraries that distinction has blurred."
